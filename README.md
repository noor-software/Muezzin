## Adhan "always-on" iPad App requirements (feel free to add as needed)

### Display:
* Works in **landscape** mode and support **split view** (also called multitasking)
* Displays 5 daily prayer times and highlights the **current** prayer and **countdown** to the next one (the app HUDA has a good UI actually, see screenshot below)

### Adhan and Alarms:
* Allows the selection of your own **Adhan audio file** for each prayer either as an MP3 or fetch it from your iTunes/Apple music library (can be different for each prayer, not one for all like many apps force you to do)
* Allows to set up **pre-Adhan alarms** (not notifications, but alarms that play within the app) and allows to select which sound to use for the alarm
* Plays the Adhan **within the app** and not as a notification (to avoid the restrictions associated with notifications)
* Plays the Fajr alarm within the app and not as a notification (to avoid the restrictions associated with notifications)
* When the alarm or Adhan is playing, displays a **splashscreen** with the ability to switch the alarm or adhan off (like for the Huda app). If nothing is done the splashscreen should **disappear** within ~5 min of the alarm or at the end of the Adhan

### Calendar:
* Displays **current date** in Hijri
* Displays **date** of the next islamic event and **countdown** (in months and days) to that event (in the settings it should allow to select which islamic events to track)
